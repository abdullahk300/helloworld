        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>I am 13 years old and I am learning how to code. I've been coding for about a month and I am really enjoying it. I want to become a software developer when I grow up. In my opinion, I think coding is <strong>a lot</strong> more fun than spending hours each night memorizing facts for medicine or some other carrer choice. Because in coding you are able to make your own things or design your own websites, play around with different things.</p>
