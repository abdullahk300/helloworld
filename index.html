        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        <h2>My name is Abdullah</h2>
        <p>And <em>this</em> is my first website.</p>
        <h2>All About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Abdullah. I am 13 years old and am in grade 8. My favourite food is Pizza and my favourite colour is blue. At this point your probably thinking... Well you said <em>All About Me</em> and you just told me what your favourite colour is!? Well yes, your right, I did, and if you want to learn more about me, you can just click one of the links below.</p>
        <a><h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>I've been coding for about a month and I am really enjoying it. I want to become a software developer when I grow up. In my opinion, I think coding is <strong>a lot</strong> more fun than spending hours each night memorizing facts for medicine or some other carrer choice. Because in coding you are able to make your own things or design your own websites, play around with different things.</p>
